first question

we just read the file name 
we taking the number of line in num
then doing dividing by two for even number of line 
and for odd number of line dividing and adding 1 to it.

then if we directly use num it gives an error so we convert it to decimal than use it.

we use NR to go to a particular line and with $0 we print whole line.


second question

making reggex to filter the shell starting with /usr.
pipeline it to awk command to print the last column.
"$NF" is used to print the last column of filtered data.
